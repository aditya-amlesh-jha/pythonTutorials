Time complexity: The amount of time taken by an algorithm to execute a function

Space complexity: The amount of memory taken by an algorithm to execute a function

Big O notation: A way to represent the time and space complexity of an algorithm


N = 1024
j = 0
count = 0
while j<=N
    j*=2
    count +=1
    print(count)

TC = 1+1+N+1
TC = O(N)
