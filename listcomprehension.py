# Purpose: To implement list comprehension in python

# List comprehension is a way to create a list using a single line of code  

# Example 1: Create a list of squares from 1 to 10
squares = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)] 

# Example 2: Create a list of even numbers from 1 to 10
even = [i for i in range(1,11) if i % 2 == 0]

# Create a map from list comprehension 
# Example 3: Create a map of squares from 1 to 10
squares_map = {i:i**2 for i in range(1,11)}
